== Building Docs with docToolchain: A Quickstart Guide

This guide explains how to use docToolchain to build great docs using
the docs-as-code methodology. You’ll get from zero to hero in only a few
steps:

. Installing the tool.
. Setup and configuration.
. Building your docs.
. Publishing docs to HTML.
. Deploying your docs.

== What Is Docs-as-Code?

Docs-as-code means treating your docs just like developers treat code.
This approach is perfect for technical teams because everyone writes
docs using similar tools, practices, and workflows.

The docs-as-code approach takes all the things we love about software
development and makes them relevant to docs:

* Version control using Git.
* Collaboration and review.
* Consistent design.
* Automated testing, building, and delivery.
* Issue tracking.
* Use of plain-text markup (Markdown, reStructuredText, AsciiDoc).

In addition to the above, docs-as-code helps build a culture where
developers and technical writers can easily work side-by-side using
similar tools.

== What is docToolchain?

http://doctoolchain.org/docToolchain/v2.0.x/10_about/20_what-is-doctoolchain.html[docToolchain]
is an open-source documentation generation tool that uses the
docs-as-code approach. It was initially developed by
https://www.polywork.com/rdmueller[Ralf D. Müller] and now has over 70
contributors. It takes markup files and uses them to create technical
documentation in several formats, including websites, PDFs, and
presentations. Because of docToolchain’s underlying Gradle build system,
it can provide automation, which is very important for writing and
maintaining robust technical documentation.

== Before You Begin

* You will need an integrated development environment (IDE) or text
editor. In this guide, we'll use the
https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[community version of
IntelliJ IDEA] which is free to download.
* You will need to be comfortable working with the command line.

Now, let's get started!

== Installing docToolchain

You can install docToolchain in three different environments. More
information can be found in our comprehensive
http://doctoolchain.org/docToolchain/v2.0.x/020_tutorial/010_Install.html[installation]
documentation. In this guide, we’ll install docToolchain in a
Windows environment.

Install docToolchain by running the following command in your command
prompt (cmd.exe).

[source,console]
----
curl -Lo dtcw.bat doctoolchain.github.io/dtcw.bat
----

Next, verify the installation by running the following command:

[source,console]
----
./dtcw.ps1 tasks --group=doctoolchain
----

This command shows all docToolchain tasks available and verifies that
the installation was successful. The installation is an incremental
process, so it takes a while.

== Setting Up docToolchain

After installation, the first step is to get the
https://arg42.org[+++arc42 template+++] in AsciiDoc format. The arc42
template will provide you with a good starting point for your
documentation and some basic content. Get the template by running this
command:

[source,console]
----
/dtcw.ps1 downloadTemplate
----

Next, we’ll render the template to HTML and PDF by running these
commands:

[source,console]
----
./dtcw.ps1 generateHTML

./dtcw.ps1 generatePDF
----


== Building Your First Docs with docToolchain

You now have almost everything in place to start building docs with
docToolchain. For this exercise, we will replicate the Introduction
pages of the https://developers.buycoins.africa/[BuyCoins API
documentation] and
https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/home/new-to-polygon[Polygon
documentation].

First, you’ll need to know more about AsciiDoc. AsciiDoc is a markup
language. It is straightforward, allows for customization, and is
similar to Markdown. Head over to the
https://asciidoctor.org/docs/[AsciiDoc documentation] and take a
look at the https://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc[cheat sheet] to
learn how to write AsciiDoc. It would also make things easier if you use
https://thetimetube.herokuapp.com/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc Viewer] as an
online editor as you practice.

You will also need an IDE. In this guide, we use the
https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[community version of
IntelliJ IDEA] When you open docToolchain in your IDE, it will
recognize the AsciiDoc file extension and ask you to install the
IntelliJ IDEA Asciidoctor plugin. This plugin provides support for the
AsciiDoc markup language, as well as a two-pane AsciiDoc editor based on
Asciidoctor that includes a live preview.

And finally, you can use AsciiDoc to write your documentation. You can
find the source code for the AsciiDoc format of the
https://github.com/Bennykillua/Git-Markup/blob/main/BuyCoins%20API%20in%20AsciiDoc/buycoin.adoc[BuyCoins
API] and the
https://github.com/Bennykillua/Git-Markup/blob/main/Polygon/Polygon.adoc[Polygon
documentation] in GitHub.

== Creating Your First HTML Site

You’re now ready to create your first HTML site using the files you
created. But first, you need to make a change to the
`docToolchainConfig.groovy` file.

To do this, open the `docToolchainConfig.groovy file` in your IDE. Once
open, add the following after line 13:


 [file: 'arc42/chapters/Polygon.adoc', formats: ['html','pdf']],

 [file: 'arc42/chapters/Buycoin.adoc', formats: ['html','pdf']],`

image:010/image2.png[image]

Open a command prompt in your docToolchain folder and run this command:

[source,console]
----
|./dtcw.ps1 generateSite
----

image:010/image3.png[image]

Once the command has been executed, you will find your output in
`index.html` which is located at
Doctool\build\microsite\output\index.html in your docToolchain folder.

Here’s what the final output looks like:

image:010/image4.gif[image]

You can do many more things with docToolchain beyond the static site
generator, using other features like `exportExcel` and `generatePDF`.
Look out for future guides and tutorials!

== Deploying your Docs

You can use your static HTML sites to deploy your documentation wherever
you want, just like you would with any static site. However, there are
various ways to achieve this. One of the easiest is to use
https://pages.github.com/[GitHub Pages] or
https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify].

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes your source
codes directly from a GitHub repository, runs them through a build
process, then publishes a website. Your site will be hosted on GitHub's
github.io domain or your own custom domain. Learn more by reading the
https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site[documentation].

On the other hand, Netlify allows you to deploy your application
automatically in seconds by running the `deploy` command on every branch
push. First, create a Netlify account, link it to your GitHub account,
then select the repository. You then specify your build command as well
as the destination folder. This
https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/[documentation]
will teach you how to do that.

== Summary and Next Steps 

In this guide, you learned about docs-as-code, how to install
docToolchain, and how to build a simple document. You also learned how
simple it is to render a static site with docToolchain.

So, what should your next steps be? When it comes to docToolchain,
there's a whole universe to discover! In upcoming tutorials, you’ll
learn about the different features of docToolchain and get familiar with
other tasks like `exportExcel` and `generatePDF`.
